## Project Description

This single page application allows the user to search and browse files and folders in a specified directory, as well as upload and download files from the browser.

'Search', 'download', 'view', and 'widget' parameters automatically update in the URL to reflect the current state of the UI. Likewise, the user can navigate to a URL that includes any of the parameters and the UI will reflect that information.

The server-side 'rootDirectory' variable can be modified to change the app's root directory. Examples: 'admin', 'directory/reviews', 'directory/articles/featuredArticles'
